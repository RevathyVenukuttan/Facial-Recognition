## Facial-Recognition

Facial recognition on human and chimpanzee faces using the most traditional method of Eigenfaces. This method is based on the 1991 paper by Turk and Pentland.

**M. A. Turk and A. P. Pentland. Face recognition using eigenfaces. InProc. of ComputerVision and Pattern Recognition,  pages 586–591. IEEE, June 1991b. URL: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dyer/cs540/handouts/mturk-CVPR91.pdf.** 

The approach deploys Principal Component Analysis on a set of images thereby making it possible for us to represent it in a low-dimensional space. The principal components generated can be plotted to visualize the so-called Eigen faces for the collection of images inputted. Eigen faces that are created will appear as light and dark areas that are arranged in specific pattern. These patterns represent various facial features which can be singled out for evaluation.

The technique of representation of images as eigen faces can also be used for handwriting recognition, sign language/gesture recognition, lip reading etc.

Dataset for the project:
- Human data (Yale faces database): http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database
- Chimpanzee data: Data was obtained from a Chimpanzee face database C-Zoo which were collected as part of the SAISBECO project funded by the Pact for Research and Innovation between the Max Planck Society and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. The data comes from the supplementary material of : **Alexander Freytag and Erik Rodner and Marcel Simon and Alexander Loos and Hjalmar Kühl and Joachim Denzler: "Chimpanzee Faces in the Wild: Log-Euclidean CNNs for Predicting Identities and Attributes of Primates", German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), 2016**
